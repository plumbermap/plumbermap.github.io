<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work.

Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process utilized to clear particles from the side rain gutter pipes on your home.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of defense. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering the structure, however closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong method.
