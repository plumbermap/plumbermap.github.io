<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Short Hills NJ</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, especially if that water is hot, the inside of your system is probably rusty. You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it only occurs with hot water. If you resemble a lot of homeowners, you probably don't understand what type of pipes you have. A plumber from 1st Option Plumbing can inform you for sure, but in general, there are 3 main types of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
