<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Lancaster SC 29720</h3>
<p>Many house owners have standard water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. While these are cost-effective at first buy, they are not the most effective or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is obsoleted. If your hot water heater is more than 8 years old, it might be time to consider changing it with a new energy-efficient model. That's where the plumbers at Casteel comes in.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really educated, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>

<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
