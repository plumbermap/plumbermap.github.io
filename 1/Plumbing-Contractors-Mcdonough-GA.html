For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place.
