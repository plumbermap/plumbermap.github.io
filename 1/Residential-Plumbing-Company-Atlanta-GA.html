<h3>Clogged Sink in Atlanta Georgia</h2>
<p>Many house owners will discover a clog and instantly grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

Lye is developed to penetrate obstructions and dissolve them, however it also eats through your pipes and develops weak spots that are prone to burst.</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this could be serious problem if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house must have water. This opts for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working effectively, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
