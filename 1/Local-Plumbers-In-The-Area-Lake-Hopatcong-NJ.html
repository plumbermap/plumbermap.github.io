<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family residences or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>

To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
