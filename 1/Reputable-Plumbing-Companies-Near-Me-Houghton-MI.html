<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service.
