<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are exceptionally crucial to building a reputation for quality. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall. If it isn't, you'll need to either select a smaller disposer, or modify the plumbing to accommodate the brand-new setup. Nasty smells.
