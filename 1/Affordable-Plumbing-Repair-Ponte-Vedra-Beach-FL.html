Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
