<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
