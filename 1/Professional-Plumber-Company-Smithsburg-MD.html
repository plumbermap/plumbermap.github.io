<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
