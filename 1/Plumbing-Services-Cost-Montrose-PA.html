We are now ready to start the re-assembly process. Some designs require the elements to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise require the re-assembly in a particular order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the proper area. It is also important that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the components or inadvertently placed in the body.
