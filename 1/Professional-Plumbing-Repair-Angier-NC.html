<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Angier NC 27501</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
