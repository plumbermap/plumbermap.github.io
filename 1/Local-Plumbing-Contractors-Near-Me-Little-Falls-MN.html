<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task quite well, with time, it still does corrode. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>You may be wondering if it's time to replace the entire thing if you are having severe problems with your toilet. There are just many repairs that you can make prior to you need a brand-new toilet, right? Well, there are a couple of things to take into account if you are weighing your alternatives between toilet repair and toilet replacement.
