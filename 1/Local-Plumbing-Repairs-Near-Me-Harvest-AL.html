<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Harvest AL 35749?</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
