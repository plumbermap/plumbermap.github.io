<p>Like any significant home appliance, your water heater will start to wear down and show indications of aging. The majority of homeowners begin experiencing issues with their hot water heater around the 10-year mark, so if the water heater in your home was already installed when you bought it, then you may need reliable water heater replacement and installation services.</p>
