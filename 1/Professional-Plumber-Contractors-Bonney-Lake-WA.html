<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to eliminate high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause hard water. The system filters out these tough water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow service technicians, readily available through your turf irrigation company or plumber can identify whether or not your equipment satisfies the requirements. The guidelines also need a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
