<p>Water solidity is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>In order to insure the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be checked and certified upon installation and at least when a year thereafter if installed to secure form a health hazard circumstance.

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
