Whole-house designs are suitable for washing devices, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>

The mainstay for typical fire security applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 individually running spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), four test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
