<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at South Charleston WV 25309</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are tailored to your specific problem. Whether the clog remains in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. Because it assists our plumbers to know the type of clog they may be dealing with, the location of the drain is essential. Shower drains usually get hair blockages, and kitchen sink drains are susceptible to grease obstructions.</p>
<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
