The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
