<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Nettleton MS 38858?</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>One sure sign that you may need a gas line repair is if there is an actually strong, rotten egg-like odor that you simply can't pinpoint, it may be time to get in touch with Mr. Rooter Plumbing.

When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
