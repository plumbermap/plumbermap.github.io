For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
