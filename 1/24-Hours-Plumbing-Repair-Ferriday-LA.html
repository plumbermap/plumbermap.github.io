<p>Some property owners might think of water softeners as a high-end item, something that's nice to have" but not entirely necessary. However, difficult water can trigger everything from small annoyances, like spots on dishes or soap scum, to major problems like a shorter lifespan for your water heater, dishwasher, and other important home appliances. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a beneficial financial investment for your house.</p>

Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another good trick is using a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
