Nasty odor: A strong, undesirable odor coming from your drains could show one of 2 problems: food congesting the drain, or a larger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>Water discoloration: Another obvious indication of your pipes decaying is yellow or brown water coming out of your sinks or tub. Action 2: On the brand-new drain, apply plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into location. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.
