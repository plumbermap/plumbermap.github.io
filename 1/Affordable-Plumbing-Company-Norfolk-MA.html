But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
