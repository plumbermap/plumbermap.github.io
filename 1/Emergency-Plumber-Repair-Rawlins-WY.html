<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system.

Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
