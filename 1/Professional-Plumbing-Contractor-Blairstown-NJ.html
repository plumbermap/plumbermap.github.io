Any driver who neglects a leaky fuel line is clearly at major risk of becoming a fire casualty, Lavacot states, as gas is spurting from their cars and truck somewhere. Like whatever else in your home, your plumbing pipes will not last permanently. Sometimes a little leak can be repaired, but often replacing your pipes is a better long-term service.
