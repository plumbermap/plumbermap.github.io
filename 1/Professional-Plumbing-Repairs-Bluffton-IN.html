<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Bluffton IN</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If you have a large bathtub or more that 2 restrooms, this style hot water heater may make the most sense for you. There are some installation considerations, especially around sizing the gas line and installing the flue vent, however with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to produce more hot water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are quite unique. High-efficiency storage is a fantastic alternative for space heating hydronic choices too.</p>
