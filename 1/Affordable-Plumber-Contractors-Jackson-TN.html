<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Jackson TN 38305</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is in between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot. Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper costs $13 to $15 per direct foot. Copper pipe is more pricey than PEX, however it has some exceptional advantages. There are a number of parts inside of a toilet tank, and a few of them can make a toilet bowl not flush. Appropriate toilet repair can have the toilet flush fresh once again.</p>
