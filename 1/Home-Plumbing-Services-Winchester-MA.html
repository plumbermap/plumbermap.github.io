<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, typically referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency among the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the building's energy and water usage; minimize waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your house successfully remove big amounts of water and waste. With time, dirt, debris, hair, and numerous other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly supporting. When this takes place, it may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
