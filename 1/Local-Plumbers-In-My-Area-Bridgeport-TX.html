<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
