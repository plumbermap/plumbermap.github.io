<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
