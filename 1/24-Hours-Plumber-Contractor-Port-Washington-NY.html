<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they also offer the least amount of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc seals and rises off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home efficiently remove large quantities of water and waste. With time, dirt, particles, hair, and numerous other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously backing up.
