<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with firmness ions.

The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
