The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
