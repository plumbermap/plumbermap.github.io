This device consists of no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
