Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
