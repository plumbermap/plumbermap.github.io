<p>In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to remove small sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to complete. Don't fret, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furniture, floorings and other valuables so that our work does not make a mess. After the whole process is completed and your home is tidied up, we'll test to make sure that water is streaming correctly through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
