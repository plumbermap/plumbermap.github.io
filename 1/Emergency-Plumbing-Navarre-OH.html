<p>When they are caught in a prompt fashion, remember that the majority of plumbing problems are easy for a professional to fix.

<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) innovation. SACr physically gets rid of temporary hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of present softening technologies.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.
