<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
