Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can duplicate this procedure. Galvanized steel pipes are ideal for irrigation and water supply lines, but they are typically not used in brand-new buildings today.

Suggestion: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.
