PVC assemblies are a great choice s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>

For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
