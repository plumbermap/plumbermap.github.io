<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Stockbridge GA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the house is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE cost-effective than mold removal or replacing flooring or drywall! So we advise setting up or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
