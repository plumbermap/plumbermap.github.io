<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Groton CT 06340</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and re-install locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter has remained in the drain cleaning service given that 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the very first electric drain cleaning machine and established the first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the technology hasn't changed much from Blanc's timeless invention, and uses blades to cut through particles to bring back correct water circulation.</p>
<p>Eliminate all parts of the disposer package from the box, and arrange the contents. Eliminate the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Location a big pan below the sink to capture water that might spill when you detach the drain, and keep a towel close by to clean up spills.

Whether your heater needs a small fix or a more substantial overhaul, our plumbers have the skill to work on every make and model of hot water heater out there.</p>
