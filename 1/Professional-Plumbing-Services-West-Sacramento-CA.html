<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In West Sacramento CA</h3>

We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

If you do have frequent leakages, we discover that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-term service.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
