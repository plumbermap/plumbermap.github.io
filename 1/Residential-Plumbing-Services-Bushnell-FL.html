<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater rather than a system with an electric heating component, there is a great chance your pilot burner has headed out. This might be because of a problem with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or simply a strong breeze.
