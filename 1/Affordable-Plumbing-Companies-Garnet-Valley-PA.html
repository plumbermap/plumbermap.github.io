It can cause water to construct all the way up your drains and produce a leak someplace along the method if the P-trap under you sink is clogged.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
