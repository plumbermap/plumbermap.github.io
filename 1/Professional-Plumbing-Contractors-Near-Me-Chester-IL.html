<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need.

The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
