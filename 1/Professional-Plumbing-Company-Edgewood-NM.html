<p>In water supply systems, water is normally kept at a considerable pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with appliance wires attached, and others do not. If yours doesn't, get rid of the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the producer's directions. A lot of standard disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're completed, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
