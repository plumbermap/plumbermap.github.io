Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
