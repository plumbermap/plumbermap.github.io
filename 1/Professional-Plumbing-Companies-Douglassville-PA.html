<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
