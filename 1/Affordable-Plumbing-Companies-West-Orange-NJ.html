Please note that Virginia's Building Code forbids using any plumbing components or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your project.

<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be suggested on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and then yearly.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
