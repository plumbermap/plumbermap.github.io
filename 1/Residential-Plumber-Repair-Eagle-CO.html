<p>If you discover an odor or undesirable smell coming from your system, which is not uncommon, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are widely readily available and simple to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware shops. Shut off the supply of water to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut down the water supply to your house. Ensure your hot water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electrical energy running to the system.</p>
