A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health hazards but works against back-siphonage just.</p>
