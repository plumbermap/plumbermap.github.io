<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system.

<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention choices, however they also supply the least amount of security.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
