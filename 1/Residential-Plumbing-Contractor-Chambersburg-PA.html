<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
