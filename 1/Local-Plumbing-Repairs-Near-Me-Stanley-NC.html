<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Stanley NC 28164</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
