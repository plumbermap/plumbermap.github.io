<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall be applicable to small repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings besides Group R-3 occupancies, a license and inspection will be needed for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor wing, level, or area is involved, even though the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall building plumbing.</p>

Improper maintenance such as failure to replace filters or media at the proper time will be judged as "overlook".

If this heater is set up in a home with multiple restrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation costs.</p>
