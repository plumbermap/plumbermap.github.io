<p>Be aware that most kinds of disposals require a switch nearby to the sink to control the outlet-- the electrical expert should wire for this, too. Note: Batch-feed disposers don't need a switch due to the fact that they start when you place and turn an unique drain plug. The purpose of the plumbing code is to insure the correct installation of systems for providing drinkable water, for sanitary sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to insure public safety, health, and welfare insofar as impacted by the installation of plumbing.</p>
