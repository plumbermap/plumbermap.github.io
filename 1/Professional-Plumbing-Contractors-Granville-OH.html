<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem.

Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
