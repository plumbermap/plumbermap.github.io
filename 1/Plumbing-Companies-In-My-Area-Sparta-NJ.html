<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies should be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing suggestion notice one month before the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are two various types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I mention them only because they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
