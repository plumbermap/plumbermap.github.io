<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
