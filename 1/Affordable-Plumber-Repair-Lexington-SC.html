<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your home? Water pressure in the home resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be regulated to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is MUCH more cost-efficient than mold remediation or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend setting up or repairing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
