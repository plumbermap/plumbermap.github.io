We now have cleaned up and checked the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the elements to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the correct location. It is also crucial that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the parts or mistakenly positioned in the body. The elements need to be positioned so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
