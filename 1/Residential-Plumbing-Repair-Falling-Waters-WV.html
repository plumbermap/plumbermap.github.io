<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
