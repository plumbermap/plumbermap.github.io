The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so deadly that anybody who inhales it needs immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make certain to utilize your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never to use them to warm your house. The very same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, make sure someone is awake to monitor them. Many households pass away in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning over night. Another safety measure to take is to never ever run your generators in enclosed areas.
