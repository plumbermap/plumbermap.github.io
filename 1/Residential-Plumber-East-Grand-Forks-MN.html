Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
