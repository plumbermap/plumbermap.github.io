<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year.
