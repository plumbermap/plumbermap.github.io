<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select should be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
