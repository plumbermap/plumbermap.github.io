<p>The concern of leakage can be credited to any variety of aspects which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking location when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
