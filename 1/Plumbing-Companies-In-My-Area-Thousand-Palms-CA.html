<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>

Master plumbers shall not charge for their services grossly extreme rates, or otherwise take undue benefit of an unsuspecting public.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
