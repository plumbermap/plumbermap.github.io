<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
