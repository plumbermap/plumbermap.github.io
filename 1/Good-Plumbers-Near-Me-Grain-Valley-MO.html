<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
