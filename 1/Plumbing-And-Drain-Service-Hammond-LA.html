<p>The typical cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending on the size and design. They are safer to utilize than constant feed disposals, but are not advised for families that produce a lot of food waste. Instead of a switch, the batch feed waste disposal unit is activated by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
