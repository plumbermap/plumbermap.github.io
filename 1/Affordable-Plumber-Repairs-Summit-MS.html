<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
