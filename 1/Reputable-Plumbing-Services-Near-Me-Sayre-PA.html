<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each component.
