Fruit and Drain Flies - Do you see tiny flies spending time your sink? This may be an indication of a clogged drain. When garbage, waste, and sewage clog a drain, they bring in flies.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically 2 layers of protection. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I mention them just because they will be on a certification test.</p>
