The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
