<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing San Mateo CA</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
