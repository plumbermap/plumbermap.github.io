<p>When you've discovered the trip lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right method. When you've protected the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
