<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
