The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually found the journey lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right method. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
