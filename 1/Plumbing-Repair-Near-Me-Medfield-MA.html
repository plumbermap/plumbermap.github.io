In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant clogs: If the plunger has actually ended up being a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant obstructions suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power required to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
