<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
