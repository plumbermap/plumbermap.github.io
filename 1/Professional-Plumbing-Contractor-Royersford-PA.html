<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
