<h3>Water Softener Repair Installation in Morgantown West Virginia</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping.
