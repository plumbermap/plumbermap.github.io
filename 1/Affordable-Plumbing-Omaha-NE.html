<p>You may have heard stories about a warm water heater exploding inside a house or organisation! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into an unsafe time bomb. The age of your water heater. A conventional tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with appropriate maintenance and care.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
