<p>Recognition of gas, liquid and air leakages: Using electronic, thermal and acoustical imaging locating equipment to recognize leakages. Current advances in toilet technology have made contemporary restrooms much more functional and comfy. If your toilet was manufactured before 1994, then it's likely costing you money every day. New toilets utilize almost 2 gallons less per flush while using the same or better flushing power as their outdated counterparts.

And ensure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
