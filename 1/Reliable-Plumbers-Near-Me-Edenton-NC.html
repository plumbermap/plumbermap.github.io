<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first attempt putting BioSmart (offered at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also try 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inadequate or unattainable cleanouts: No matter how efficient a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually.
