<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Wixom MI</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
