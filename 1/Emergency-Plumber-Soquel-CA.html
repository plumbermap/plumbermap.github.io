<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
