<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Occasionally sharpening the blades. To clean and sharpen the blades, all you need to do is grind a few ice cubes in the disposal before running cold water through the system. 3. DO treat your garbage disposal when a month by sprinkling a 1/2 cup of baking powder down the drain, then gathering a 1/2 cup of vinegar. The mixture will bubble and fizz for a bit as it cleans up the disposal.</p>
