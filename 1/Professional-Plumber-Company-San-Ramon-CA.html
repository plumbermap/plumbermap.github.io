<p>Disputing whether to repair or replace your hot water heater? Our professionals will give you an honest suggestion. In general, older hot water heater (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are much better off being replaced.

<p>A Pilot Light That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating aspect, there is a good chance your pilot light has actually headed out.

Regardless of what the issue is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to function till the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
