<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and responsibility are extremely important to building a track record for excellence. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet need to be above the drain line coming out of the wall.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
<p>Gas leaks are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas home appliances.
