<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>We supply emergency drain repair services for broken and breached drain lines that will help you to prevent potentially larger problems in the future. Leaky and cracked drains drainage that ends up costing you cash in addition to damaging the environment.

<p>That said, you don't always need to drain 10s of thousands of dollars on fixing your home's pipe or sewer lines.

Repairs are suitable for small leaks, especially if you have plumbing that was installed in just the past ten years.

<p>The typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
