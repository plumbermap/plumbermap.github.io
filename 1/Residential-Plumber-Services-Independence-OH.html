<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
