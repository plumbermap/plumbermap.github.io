<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities.
