<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
