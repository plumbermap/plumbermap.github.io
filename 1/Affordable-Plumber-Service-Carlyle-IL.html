<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. , if you plan to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).

<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and start leaking.
