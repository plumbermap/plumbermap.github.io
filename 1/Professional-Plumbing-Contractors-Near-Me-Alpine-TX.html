Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
