<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

If your toilet bowl is broken or leaking, or if the valve assembly is shot, toilet replacement is the best option for your issue.
