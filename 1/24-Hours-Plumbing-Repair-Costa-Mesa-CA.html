The temperature level and pressure relief valve is a safety device that limits tank pressure and keeps it from exploding (Image 4). A brand-new one need to be included with every installation. For the valve to work appropriately, the discharge pipe need to be kept devoid of blockages (Fig. A).</p>
<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes place when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to assist regulate the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The solution for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
