<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
