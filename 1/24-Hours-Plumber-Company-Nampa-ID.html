<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance.

The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
