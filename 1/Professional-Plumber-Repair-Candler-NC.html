Most people dispose food waste in the garbage, which means more garbage to go in land fills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's typically foul-smelling and frequently uses plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills instead of breaking down.</p>

Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
