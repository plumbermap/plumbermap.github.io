<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cord, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family residences or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
