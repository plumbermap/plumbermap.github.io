<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've found the journey lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
