<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Kennett Square PA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
