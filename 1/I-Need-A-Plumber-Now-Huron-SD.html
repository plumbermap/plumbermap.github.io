<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a good sign, an unusual gurgling noise. Don't depend on a plunger to remedy the issue-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair.

Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
