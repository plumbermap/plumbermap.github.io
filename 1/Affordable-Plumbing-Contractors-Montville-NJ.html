<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to split and solidify or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
