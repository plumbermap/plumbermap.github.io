While some older homes might not have backflow preventers, all more recent properties are needed to have them.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components.

As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
