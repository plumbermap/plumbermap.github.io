<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can fail to carry water from roofing gutters far from your house or company when not correctly maintained. Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases blockages are unavoidable.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
