It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
