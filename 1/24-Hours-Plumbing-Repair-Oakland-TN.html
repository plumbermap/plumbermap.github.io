This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
