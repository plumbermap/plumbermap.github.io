<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually found the trip lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
