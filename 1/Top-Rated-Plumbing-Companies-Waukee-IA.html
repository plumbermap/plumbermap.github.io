<p>Reduced pressure zone assemblies (RPZ), also called decreased pressure principle assemblies, are the market standard for any kind of commercial property, consisting of apartment buildings and condominiums, because they offer the greatest level of security versus pollutants and contaminants.

<p>Primarily, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor close to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your house to the city line.) If you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have a concept of where your lateral lies. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also know the locations to avoid. Your line will be easy to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
