Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
