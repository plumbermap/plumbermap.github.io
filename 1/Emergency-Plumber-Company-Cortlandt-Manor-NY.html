<p>Like many household devices, your water heater is among those things that gets taken for granted - up until it goes kaput. Then it garners all the attention it is worthy of. Typically, the lifespan of a lot of hot water heater is between 10 and fifteen years. Naturally, this life expectancy varies according to the frequency of use and care and maintenance.

<p>When you aren't ended up or being not able to run a warm bath for your children, there's little that's more bothersome than having your shower run cold.

We determine backflow threat by evaluating the type of service, how business utilizes water, and what kind of equipment or devices are connected to the building's supply of water system.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair expense might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.</p>
