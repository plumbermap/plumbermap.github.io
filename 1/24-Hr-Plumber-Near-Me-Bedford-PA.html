<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
