<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited home appliance repair costs, you need a water softener. Tough water is not an issue that will go away by itself and the costs sustained by difficult water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, appliances will undoubtedly stop working quicker than their expected life-span. If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home. Difficult water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your energy bills will continue to barrel skyward.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
