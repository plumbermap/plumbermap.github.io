<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. , if you plan to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
