<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
