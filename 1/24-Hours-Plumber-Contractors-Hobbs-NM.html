<p>Since 1980, backflow preventers have actually been legally mandated for specific structures by the New York Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York City. The regulation was not strictly imposed up until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an effort that includes routine random inspections of New york city City structures to make sure they are in compliance.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse circulation testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are effectively evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
