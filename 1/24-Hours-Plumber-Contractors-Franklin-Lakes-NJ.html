<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>If you're working with a reputable plumber in Utah, they will normally support their deal with a guarantee. That indicates if something goes wrong later, you will have somebody who can fix it without any added costs.
