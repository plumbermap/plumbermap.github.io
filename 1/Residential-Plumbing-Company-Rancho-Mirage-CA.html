<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
