<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
