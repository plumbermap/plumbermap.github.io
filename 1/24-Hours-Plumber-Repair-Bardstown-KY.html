<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Bardstown KY 40004</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, with no signs of leakage, you can probably leave it in location.
