<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Oxford OH 45056?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
