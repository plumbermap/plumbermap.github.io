<p>It is essential to make sure the devices is always working to the best of its capabilities when it comes to your water heater. However, there are many different variables that can present problems and prevent the effectiveness of your system. Should you experience any problem with your unit, from absence of hot water to a leaking tank, contact Johnson Heating & Cooling for an inspection. We will discover exactly what is causing the issue.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
