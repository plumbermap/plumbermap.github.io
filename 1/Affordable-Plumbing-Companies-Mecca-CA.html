<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can produce noise. If your energy costs are rising, a new, greater efficiency hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting difficult water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its new area and placed there.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
