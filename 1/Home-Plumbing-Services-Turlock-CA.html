This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
