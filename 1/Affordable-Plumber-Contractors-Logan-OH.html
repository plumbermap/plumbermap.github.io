<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed properly. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire.
