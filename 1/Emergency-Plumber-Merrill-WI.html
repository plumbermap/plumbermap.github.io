He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
