Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
