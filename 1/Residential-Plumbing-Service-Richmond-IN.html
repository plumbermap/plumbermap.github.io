<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
