<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Ledyard CT 06339</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
