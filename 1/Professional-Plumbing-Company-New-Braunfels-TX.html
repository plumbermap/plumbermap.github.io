Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
