<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>They will normally stand behind their work with an assurance if you're working with a trusted plumber in Utah. That implies if something goes wrong later, you will have someone who can fix it without any included costs. The alternative do-it-yourself (Do It Yourself) technique provides no such warranties, and in most cases unless you know a lot about plumbing, there's a quite substantial danger that you may do more damage. When that occurs, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your mistakes, and chances are they will cost more and be more difficult than if you had just called a professional in the first location.</p>
