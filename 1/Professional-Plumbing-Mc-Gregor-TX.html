<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin.
