<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your home. A home's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>In a hectic household, a clogged bathtub drain can end up being a substantial problem over night. Soap, hair, family pet fur, and even bath toys can add to clogged bathtub drains.

If you can't determine the place of the clog or easily eliminate it yourself, Roto-Rooter plumbers carry all the tools of the trade needed to get your clogged bathtub drain back in service again.</p>
