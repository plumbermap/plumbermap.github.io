<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its regular flow. IRWD's potable water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "typical," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for infected water getting in the potable water distribution system.</p>
<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to drains.

Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.
