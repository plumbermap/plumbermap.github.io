<p>Any device that uses water, from small coffee pots to big refrigerators, functions more efficiently in a home with softened water. This is since there's no limescale buildup to interfere with transferring heat or blocking pipes. Improved efficiency also suggests that you'll enjoy a decrease in your energy bills, as your devices will not need to work harder or use more water in order to operate at their best.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy costs are rising, a new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling tough water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new area and positioned there.</p>
