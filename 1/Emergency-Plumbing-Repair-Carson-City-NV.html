<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Hot water heater service is typically ignored, however your water heater is among the most essential pieces of technology in your home.
