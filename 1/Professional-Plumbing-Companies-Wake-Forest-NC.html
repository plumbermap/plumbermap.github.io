Typically, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
