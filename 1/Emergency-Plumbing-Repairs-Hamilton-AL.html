Sanford & Child plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. During regrowth, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads.
