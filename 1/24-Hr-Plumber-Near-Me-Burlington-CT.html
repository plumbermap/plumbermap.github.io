<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
<p>Inspect to make sure it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has overheated, you might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
