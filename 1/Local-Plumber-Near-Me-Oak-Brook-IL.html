<p>Another duty of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to identify potable water systems that need being protected from contaminates. The cross connection control program is needed by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.

<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be gotten rid of relatively quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers shall not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take unnecessary benefit of an unwary public.</p>
