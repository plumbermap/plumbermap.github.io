They will turn off immediately if the system clogs, overheats, or ends up being overloaded. They include a button that enables you to reset the system to get it working once again.

<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't necessarily suggest they need to be changed. Properly maintained pipes may last longer, and badly kept ones or those in locations with tough water (indicating it has high mineral material), may stop working sooner, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life expectancy estimates.</p>
