Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
