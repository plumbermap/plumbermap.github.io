However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur more often than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow.
