<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
