Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur regularly than you believe! When you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
