<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from corrosion and might position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home. This may not need completely repiping your house, since newer materials may have currently been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
