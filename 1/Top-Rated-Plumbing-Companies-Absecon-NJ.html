<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
