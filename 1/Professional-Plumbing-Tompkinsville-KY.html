<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I just recently had numerous plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be happier with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons.

<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you have actually attempted to repair them require professional assistance. Continued attempts on your own can harm your lines, and you might have a more major underlying problem than you are aware of. Additionally, the longer you delay to require professional assistance, the greater the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
