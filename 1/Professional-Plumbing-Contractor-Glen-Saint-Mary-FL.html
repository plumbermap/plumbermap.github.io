<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
