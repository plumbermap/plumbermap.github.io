<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
