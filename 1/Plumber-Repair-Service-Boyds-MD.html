<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
