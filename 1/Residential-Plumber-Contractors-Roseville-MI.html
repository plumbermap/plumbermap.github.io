<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak undesirable issues on your property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>This, again, is because of the minerals present in the water you are using to wash them with. With soft water, you do not have that problem because it lacks the minerals that remain in hard water.
