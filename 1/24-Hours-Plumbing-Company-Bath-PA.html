<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>Dual Inspect Valve - Model GF8080, GF8080E - The Double Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is basically a stripped down Check Valve without turned off valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are usually utilized by water companies and set up after a water meter to prevent the meter from running in reverse and low security against backflow. This piece of equipment is the center of debate with lots of backflow authorities and should never ever be confused with Double Check Valves. Consult local authorities for needed installation, as most do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention gadgets.</p>
