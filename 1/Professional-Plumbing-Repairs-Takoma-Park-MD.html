<p>A recently installed water heater ought to not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen dramatically for homes with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line during installation. Fewer parts in the system lead to fewer tankless water heater repair consultations.</p>
