<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Blaine WA</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you pick must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke, however it's extremely serious if you want to genuinely get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list.
