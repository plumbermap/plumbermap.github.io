<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Vassar MI</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
