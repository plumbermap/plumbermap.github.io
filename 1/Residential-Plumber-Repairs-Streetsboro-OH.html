<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken home appliance is annoying to handle, the bright side is that setting up a replacement disposal will be cheaper than setting up a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never ever had one in the past. Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
