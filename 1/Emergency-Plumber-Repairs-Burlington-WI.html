<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
