<p>Leaks are tricky. You may need to pay for the installation of electrical circuitry if there is no grounded outlet present to power the waste disposal unit. The cost of products for a grounded outlet will likely cost in between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to hire an electrical contractor If your installation requires a new switch, expect to spend an extra $5 to $10 on products, and $50 for labor.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again crucial for the repair service technician to be familiar with the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or corrosion. It is necessary that the repair technician is delicate to the solidity and type of the different coverings utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective finishing.</p>
