<p>You can also depend on water softeners to reduce your everyday operating expense by saving detergent and enabling you to utilize lower water temperature levels while preserving a high-quality wash. Water firmness, determined by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies throughout the U.S. from a little difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
