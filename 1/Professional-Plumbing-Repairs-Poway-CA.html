<p>A freshly set up water heater need to not produce strange noises, however it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate considerably for families with a high demand for warm water.

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions.
