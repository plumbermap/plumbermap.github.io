Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up.
