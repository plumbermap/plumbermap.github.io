<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
