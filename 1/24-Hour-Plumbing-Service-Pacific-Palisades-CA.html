<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
