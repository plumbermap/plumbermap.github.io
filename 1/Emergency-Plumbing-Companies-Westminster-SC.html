<p>If your pipes are older than these guidelines, it doesn't necessarily imply they need to be changed. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and badly maintained ones or those in locations with hard water (suggesting it has high mineral content), might stop working earlier, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.

When the piping in your home begins to show any of these signs of rust, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the entire plumbing system.</p>
