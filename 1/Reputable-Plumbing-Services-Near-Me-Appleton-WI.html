<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, but they likewise offer the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc rises and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are very experienced, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely suggest them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
