<p>We have a clean and long  lasting repipe or piping alternative for your house. It is called PEX cross-linked polyethylene and Uponor pipe tubing. If you take a close take a look at the image you will see a pipe that is meant to remain clean on the within.  Because of the non metallic of the versatile nature of this item, there is no other way that it will ever rust on the within.</p>
<p>The usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
