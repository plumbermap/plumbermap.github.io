<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Glasgow KY 42141</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
