<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
