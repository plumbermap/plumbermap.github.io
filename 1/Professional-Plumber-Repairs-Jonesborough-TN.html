<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.

<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
