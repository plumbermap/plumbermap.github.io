<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
