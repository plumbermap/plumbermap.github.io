<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
