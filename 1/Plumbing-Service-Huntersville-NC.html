You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the exact same thing, however without the zinc covering.

It is again essential for the repair specialist to be knowledgeable about the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale growth or rust.
