<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Braselton GA</h3>
<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The steps for replacing a lp water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we recommend replacing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
