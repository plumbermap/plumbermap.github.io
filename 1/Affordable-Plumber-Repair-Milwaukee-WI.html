<p>Leakages are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
