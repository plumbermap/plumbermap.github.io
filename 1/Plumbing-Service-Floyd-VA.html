<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
