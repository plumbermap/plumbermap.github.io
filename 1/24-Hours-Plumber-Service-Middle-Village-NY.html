Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
