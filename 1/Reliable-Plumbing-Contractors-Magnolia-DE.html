<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
