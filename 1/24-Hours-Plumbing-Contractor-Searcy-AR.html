<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One common way for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>
