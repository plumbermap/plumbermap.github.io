<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
