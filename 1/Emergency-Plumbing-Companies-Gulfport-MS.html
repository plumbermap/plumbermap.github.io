<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined.

That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
