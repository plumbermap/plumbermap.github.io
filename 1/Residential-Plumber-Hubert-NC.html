<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess. They, as with each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and very educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either little or big job plumbing work.</p>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" design softener, making it a hassle-free and reliable system for your home. Friendly, educated technician. He got our drain cleaned out in a professional and really efficient way. I would not think twice to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements.
