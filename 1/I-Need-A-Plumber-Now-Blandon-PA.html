<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to go through. The pipes often make weird gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
