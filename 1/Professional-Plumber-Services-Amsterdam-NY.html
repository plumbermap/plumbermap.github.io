<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
