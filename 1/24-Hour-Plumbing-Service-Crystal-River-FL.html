The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect versus back siphonage.</p>
