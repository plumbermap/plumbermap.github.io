<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water.
