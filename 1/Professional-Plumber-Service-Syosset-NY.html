<p>Hard water use might affect the efficiency of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with big accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits likewise collect to plug plumbing components and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, therefore affecting their performance.</p>
