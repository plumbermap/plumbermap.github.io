Replacing the pipes for lots of plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>

It's likely that the new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. Most drains are connected to the sink by a large nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
