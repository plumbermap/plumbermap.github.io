<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is simple and low-cost. But finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are often readily available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be difficult to discover.
