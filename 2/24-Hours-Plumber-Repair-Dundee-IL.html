<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely suggest them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
