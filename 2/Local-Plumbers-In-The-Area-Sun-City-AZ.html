<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
