<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Buckeye AZ 85326</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>
