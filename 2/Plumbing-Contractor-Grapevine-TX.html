<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.
