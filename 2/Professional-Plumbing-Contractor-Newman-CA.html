<p>As soon as you've discovered the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way.
