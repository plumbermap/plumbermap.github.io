During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
