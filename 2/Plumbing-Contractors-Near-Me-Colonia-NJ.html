Offset the lines as needed with sets of 45-degree elbows if the tubing doesn't line up.</p>

Now, there are numerous solutions to obstructions, relying on the intensity of the clog.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
