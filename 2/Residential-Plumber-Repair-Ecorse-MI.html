<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become trapped between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately block the circulation of your water before triggering a clog.

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
