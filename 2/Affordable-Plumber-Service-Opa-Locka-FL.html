<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical.

Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
