<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Boonsboro MD 21713</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
