<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
