<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
