It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
