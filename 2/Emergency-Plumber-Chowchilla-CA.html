<p>Wanting to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Lots of clogs are triggered by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Know just how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never put any paper item into the toilet bowl besides bathroom tissue. Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drain. Womanly hygiene items need to be disposed of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>Inspect to ensure it's not your garbage disposal that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink.</p>
