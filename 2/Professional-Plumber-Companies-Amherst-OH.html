Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and remained in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being significantly typical, with a variety of products and fittings used.</p>
