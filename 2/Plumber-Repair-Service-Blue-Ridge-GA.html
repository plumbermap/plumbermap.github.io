<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our stiff trust accreditation standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs pricey and challenging, suggesting a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair professional to be familiar with the solidity of the products so that their cleaning procedure is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale development or deterioration. It is very important that the repair service technician is sensitive to the hardness and type of the different finishes used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective coating.</p>
