We are now ready to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the parts to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each component is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the correct place.
