You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its task quite well, over time, it still does wear away.

The very best way to prevent drain blockages is to see what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they have not currently) and need to be changed as quickly as possible.</p>
