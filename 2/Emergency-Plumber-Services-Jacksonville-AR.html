<p>Rust: The most typical problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is especially true if you have untreated difficult water, which consists of extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks frequently imply a new system replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
