<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Tankless electric water heaters come in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are powerful and large enough to provide warm water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and home appliances in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide hot water to particular spaces or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same way. The only distinction is the quantity of water they can heat up at any offered time. Also, whole-house systems are significantly more costly than the point of use systems.</p>
