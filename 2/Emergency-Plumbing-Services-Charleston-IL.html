<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening up any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can definitely be a large undertaking, which is why the service is just carried out when absolutely essential. Initially, your plumber will choose which piping material to use for the task, either copper or plastic. Replacing and installing new pipes can take anywhere between 3-5 days depending on the size of your home.</p>

These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.
