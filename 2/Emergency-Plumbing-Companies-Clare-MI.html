<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. It's interesting that you point out that using a water softener in your house benefits the health of your skin.

Electric heaters can do just that.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This average life expectancy estimation presumes regular wear and tear of the system. The life-span of a garbage disposal may be lower in the case of overlook, overuse, and abuse of the disposal system. Time for a new bathroom or kitchen sink installation?
