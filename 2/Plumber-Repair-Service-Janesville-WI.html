<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
