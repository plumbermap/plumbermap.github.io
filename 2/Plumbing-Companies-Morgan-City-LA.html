<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction between them?
