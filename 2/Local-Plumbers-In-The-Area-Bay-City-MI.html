<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
