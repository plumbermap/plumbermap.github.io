<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
