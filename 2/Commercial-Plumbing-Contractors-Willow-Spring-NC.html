During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
