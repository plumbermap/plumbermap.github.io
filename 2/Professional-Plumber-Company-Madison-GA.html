<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
