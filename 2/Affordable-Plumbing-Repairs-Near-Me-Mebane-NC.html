When it's time for replacement, here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers need to have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
