<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
