It is important that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly.
