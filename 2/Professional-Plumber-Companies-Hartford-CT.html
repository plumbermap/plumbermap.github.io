<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in locations where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>

<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce unusual sounds, however it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things intensify significantly for families with a high need for hot water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
