<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Rockland MA</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
