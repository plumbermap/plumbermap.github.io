<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more frequently than you think! Typically it occurs at night when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes.

This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
