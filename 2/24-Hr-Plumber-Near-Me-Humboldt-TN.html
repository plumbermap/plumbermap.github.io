<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
