<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals.

Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
