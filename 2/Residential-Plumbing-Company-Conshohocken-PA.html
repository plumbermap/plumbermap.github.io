If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem.
