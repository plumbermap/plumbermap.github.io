<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
