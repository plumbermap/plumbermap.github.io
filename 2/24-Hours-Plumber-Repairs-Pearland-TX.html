You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it just occurs with hot water. If you're like most property owners, you most likely don't understand what type of pipes you have.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
