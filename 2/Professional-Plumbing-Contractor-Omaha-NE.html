<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Omaha NE 68104</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
