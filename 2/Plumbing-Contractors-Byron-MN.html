<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and duty are exceptionally essential to building a track record for excellence.

<h3>Washing Machine Hook Up in Byron Minnesota</h2>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
