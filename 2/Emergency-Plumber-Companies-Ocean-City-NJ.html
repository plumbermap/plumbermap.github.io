<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing experts when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention gadgets run by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, safe and clean water can stream both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the potable water supply.

Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
