<p>Leaks are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

There can be numerous reasons someone is experiencing problems with their drains or sewer lines, and only a professional can offer an appropriate diagnosis. We ask that you do not lose any time attempting to figure out the factor behind your plumbing problems, as this can further postpone seeking the professional support you need.</p>
