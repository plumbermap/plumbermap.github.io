<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
