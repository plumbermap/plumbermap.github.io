<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is incredibly hard, all the inbound water does not need to be softened.

Measure the water usage at the designated connections for each person in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>
