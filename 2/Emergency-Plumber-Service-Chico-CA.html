<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
