Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
