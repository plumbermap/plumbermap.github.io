<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 available methods. There are insufficient words that I can use to express how awesome this team is. From getting a brand-new hot water heater when I initially moved in, to showing up at 10pm because a pipe busted in my tub and I had water leaking through my light fixtures.

This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
