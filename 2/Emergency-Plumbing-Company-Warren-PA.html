<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be treated easily if the blockage is shallow and simple. For many blockages you'll simply need a plunger, and often some chemicals, but if this doesn't solve the issue then you might also need to hire a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
