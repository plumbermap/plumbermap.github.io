Then find and view the numbers on your house's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the quicker those numbers go up, the bigger the leak.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense might be in the $300 range.
