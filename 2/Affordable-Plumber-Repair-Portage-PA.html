<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health danger or health risk conditions. They should be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
