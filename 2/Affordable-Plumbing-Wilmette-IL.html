<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
