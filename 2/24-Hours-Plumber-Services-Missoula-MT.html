<h3>Sewer Pipe in Missoula Montana</h2>
<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as detailed listed below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
<p>Add more hot water if it gradually drains away as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a brand-new method.
