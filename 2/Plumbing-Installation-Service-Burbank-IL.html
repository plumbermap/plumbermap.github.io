<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to us. Get cleaner clothes, get rid of rust spots, and use less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house designs are appropriate for washing makers, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>

Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly don't want to do the job before it's needed. Here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>A. Double check valve assembly backflow preventers are often discovered on water lines servicing fire lawn sprinkler, commercial pool, water treatment tanks, among others. Local code will define what products in your area needs which particular kind of backflow prevention device. Constantly consult your local code authorities with any concerns regarding backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Brand name brand-new garbage disposals work faster and more efficiently than older designs, conserving you time and energy expenses in the long run.
