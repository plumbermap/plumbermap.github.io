<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Company in Asbury Park</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation. On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include products or parts. Costs depend upon the exact repair required, where you live, employing a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
