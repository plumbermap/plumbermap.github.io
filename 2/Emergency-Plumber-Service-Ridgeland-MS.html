If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
