However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
