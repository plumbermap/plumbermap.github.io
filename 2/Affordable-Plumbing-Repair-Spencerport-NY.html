Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts the use of any plumbing components or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your job.

<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating effect on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential drains and are more susceptible to clogs and clog. All backflow preventers should be evaluated annually by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be provided to us.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house. Normally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
