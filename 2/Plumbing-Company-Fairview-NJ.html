<p>This article aims to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing facts that typically lead people to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Fairview NJ 07022</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
