A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>

<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
