<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
