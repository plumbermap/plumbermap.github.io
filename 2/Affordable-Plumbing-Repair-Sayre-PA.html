<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
