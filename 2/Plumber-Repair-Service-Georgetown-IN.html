<p>Leakages are sly. If there is no grounded outlet present to power the garbage disposal, you might need to pay for the installation of electrical wiring. The cost of materials for a grounded outlet will likely cost between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to work with an electrician If your installation needs a new switch, expect to spend an additional $5 to $10 on products, and $50 for labor.</p>
