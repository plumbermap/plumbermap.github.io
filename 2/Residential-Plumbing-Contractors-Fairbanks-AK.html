<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Fairbanks AK 99709?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
