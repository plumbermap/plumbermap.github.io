<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports.

Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
