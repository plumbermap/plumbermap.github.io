<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
