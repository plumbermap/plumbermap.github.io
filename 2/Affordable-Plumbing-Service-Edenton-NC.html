<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've discovered the journey lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
