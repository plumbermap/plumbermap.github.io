<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in El Monte CA 91732</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and for that reason the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
