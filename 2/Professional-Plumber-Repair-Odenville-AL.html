<p>No other room in a home consists of as numerous pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and checked the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly process. Some designs require the components to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Many components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the correct location. It is also important that as they are placed back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the components or accidentally put in the body. The components should be put so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
