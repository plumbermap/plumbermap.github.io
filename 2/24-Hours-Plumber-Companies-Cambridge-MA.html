<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Cambridge MA 02139</h3>
<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are easier and cheaper to install as electrical energy is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a feasible source of gas developed. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
