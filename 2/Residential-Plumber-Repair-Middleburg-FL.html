<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. When a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on debris. Put warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the waste disposal unit to remove grease. Another excellent trick is utilizing a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
