<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
