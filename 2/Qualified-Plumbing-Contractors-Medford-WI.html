<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
