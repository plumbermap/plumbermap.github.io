<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Most demand for plumbers will stem from brand-new building and the need to keep and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to embrace changes to building codes that require the use of fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain.
