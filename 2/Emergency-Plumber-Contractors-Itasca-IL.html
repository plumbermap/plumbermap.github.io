<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
