<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
