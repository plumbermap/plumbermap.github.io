<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
