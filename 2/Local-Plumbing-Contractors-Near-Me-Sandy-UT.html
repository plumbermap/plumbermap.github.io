<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
