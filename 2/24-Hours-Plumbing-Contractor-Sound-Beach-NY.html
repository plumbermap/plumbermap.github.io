When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively.

A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and simply needs to be replaced.</p>
