<p>Yes, we have actually all existed, when the toilet clogs and we're left feeling helpless without the power to flush! A clog usually involves increasing water, followed by panic and plunging. If this is a common event, there's most likely a larger problem of obstruction in the drain or sewer-line. Our plumbers can assist you to determine and eliminate the problem-- quick.</p>

For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
