<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from corroding.

If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and must be changed as quickly as possible.</p>
