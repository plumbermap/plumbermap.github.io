<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. Figure out the size of the pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply adequate flow.</p>
