<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Gardner Kansas</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
