<p>A freshly installed hot water heater need to not produce odd noises, but it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things aggravate significantly for households with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
