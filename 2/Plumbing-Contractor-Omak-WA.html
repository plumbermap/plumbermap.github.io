<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbers will be out to you in no time, and we will have your clogged drain fixed in brief order. We understand what a hassle it can be if something like your kitchen sink or (even worse) a frequently-used toilet ends up being clogged, so we will work quickly to solve the problem and get your pipes and plumbing back in proper working order. Likewise, make certain to have a look at our remarkable drain and plumbing service specials to see if the work you need done qualifies for a discount rate.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
