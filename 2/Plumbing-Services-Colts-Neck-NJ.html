<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
