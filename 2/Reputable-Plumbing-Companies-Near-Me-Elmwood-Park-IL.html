<p>Ensuring plumbing devices such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are isolated to their own particular networks is crucial in order to preserve drinkable water safety. When purchasing a house or flat, having a plumbing inspection is pretty basic. If it's a rental I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.

<p>We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the distinction in between them?
