<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines.
