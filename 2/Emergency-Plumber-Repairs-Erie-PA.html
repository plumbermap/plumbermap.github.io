Keep away from strong chemicals: Commercial drain cleaners, bleach, and other strong chemicals must never be used in your garbage disposal. From above the sink, place the flange into the drain hole and press down uniformly. With lowered energy usage, lowered water consumption, less sewage, and an as needed system, tankless hot water heater are a green option to warm water tanks.
