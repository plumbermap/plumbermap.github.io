<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage concerns. When a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on debris. Put hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another good trick is utilizing a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
