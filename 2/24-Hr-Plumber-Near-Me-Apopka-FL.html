<p>Pools of septic waste. One of the more obvious outdoor indications is if you can see sewage pooling in your yard. If your backyard smells foul and there's a puddle that simply will not go away, the issue could be a broken main sewer line. The waste disposal unit is leaking: This is caused by a worn-out hose or seal. We'll completely inspect your system to find the issue and perform the needed repair.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
