Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the whole fixture.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.
