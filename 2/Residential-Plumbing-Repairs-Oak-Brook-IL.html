They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
