<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
