<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we may utilize a range of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Detach garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>There are two types of piping that are used in the repiping process. Copper piping and PEX piping are utilized because of their effectiveness, safety and cost. Copper piping prevents germs from growing inside of the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both lightweight and flexible. This material is resistant against rust and will help improve water pressure.</p>
