<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dosage, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an impact on detergent savings. The research study consisted of tests that removed hard soils, in addition to assessing recording and spotting. Scientists found that softened water uses practically 30% less detergent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg firmness level. That cleaning agent savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
