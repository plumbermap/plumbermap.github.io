<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on swift service, accurate troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your organisation never ever needs to suffer from downtime. To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equal parts of vinegar and baking soda regularly. For regular cleaning, you'll just need about one-half cup of each.
