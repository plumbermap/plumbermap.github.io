<p>about shows, setting, repairing or replacing your softener.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house.
