<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
