<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
