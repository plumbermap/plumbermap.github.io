A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Union NJ</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
