<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Elba AL</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>It's important to be aware that a lot of scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by hard water if your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation. Difficult water usually leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being rather undesirable. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning methods will definitely help, we strongly suggest you look into setting up a water softener to help with your hard water.</p>
