<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe should be utilized that is covered with a special plastic product that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily discernible from underground water lines, and likewise because the plastic coating in fact protects the pipe better than a galvanized finish would.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more prone and fragile to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to rust and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat strain, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and strains as an outcome of temperature level change and ice formation.

<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
