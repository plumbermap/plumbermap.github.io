Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and often go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can likewise weaken your drain system and trigger separations. Because the source of leaking water can be hard to detect, our plumbers often perform a color test to determine the source. Frequently, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to discover they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly unclean or stained and frequently gets mistaken for a supply of water line leak.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are thought about a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and after that each year.</p>
