<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes.

If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-term option.</p>
