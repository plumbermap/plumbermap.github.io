<p>No other room in a house consists of as numerous pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials.

PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
