<h3>Toilet Drain in Andrews South Carolina</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
