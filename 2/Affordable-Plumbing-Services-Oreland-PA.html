<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Mold Growth: Mold development is another regrettable side effect if you need a sewer line repaired. This is most typical when you also have a smell of sewage along with it. The mold growth would probably be behind your walls but will begin to leak through in time. You will more than likely see a white residue on your wall near an area where a sewer pipe lies.</p>
