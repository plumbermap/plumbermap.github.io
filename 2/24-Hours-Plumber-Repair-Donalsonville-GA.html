Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
