<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be carried out by a professional plumber if you want it to work well for years to come. It is a relatively simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which pulverizes the scraps. When they are small enough, they pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of. If you have a battle drain setup, it normally takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on simply one side.</p>
