A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
