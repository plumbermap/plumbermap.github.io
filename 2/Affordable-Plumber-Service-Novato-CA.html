<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Novato CA</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>This post intends to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a couple of complicated facts that typically lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is typically corrosive. Therefore, softened water must likewise be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
