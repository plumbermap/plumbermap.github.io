<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Nederland TX 77627</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
