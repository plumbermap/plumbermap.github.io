Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to ruin micro-organisms and supply cleansed water. The cost is approximately the exact same for installing a propane gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have gas go to the house. Find out which type of gas your home currently has. Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get changed when repiped.</p>
<p>Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise require a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing usually requires a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.

You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leakages.
