<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
