From under the sink, slide the fiber gasket, backup flange and installing flange over the sink flange. Hold these pieces in location.

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
