<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 various occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, similar to each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and really experienced. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either large or small task plumbing work.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
