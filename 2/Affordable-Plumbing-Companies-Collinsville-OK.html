While some of these issues can be attributed to typical wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your garbage disposal becomes damaged by items that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>Whether you're remodeling your bathroom or just upgrading old fixtures, replacing a toilet can be a huge task if you have actually never done it in the past. If you aren't feeling great about completing a toilet installation yourself, or if you reveal any bathroom plumbing problems throughout your remodel, Roto-Rooter plumbers are readily available to assist you out.
