<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
<p>This, once again, is due to the minerals present in the water you are utilizing to clean them with.
