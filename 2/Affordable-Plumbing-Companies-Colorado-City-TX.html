<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our stiff trust certification requirements. A great general rule is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs pricey and hard, suggesting a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
