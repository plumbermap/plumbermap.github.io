<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them?
