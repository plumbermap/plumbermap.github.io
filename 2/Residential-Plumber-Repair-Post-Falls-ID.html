<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
