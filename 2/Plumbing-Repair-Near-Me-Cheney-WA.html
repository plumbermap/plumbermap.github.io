<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is essential to the safety of your staff members and customers. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Move the new hot water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together utilizing copper slip couplings. If the tubing doesn't line up, offset the lines as required with pairs of 45-degree elbows.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the brand-new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
