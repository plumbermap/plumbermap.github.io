They will shut down automatically if the system clogs, overheats, or becomes overloaded. They consist of a button that enables you to reset the unit to get it working once again.

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Wytheville VA 24382!</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
