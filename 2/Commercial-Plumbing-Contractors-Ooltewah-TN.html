For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
