<p>If you have read the paragraph above, you now understand that there different mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that allow your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl. When these parts become worn or break they need to be changed.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
