<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Emporia KS</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
