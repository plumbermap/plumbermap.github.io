The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
