<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
