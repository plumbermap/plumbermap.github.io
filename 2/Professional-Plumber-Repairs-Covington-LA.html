<p>Thank you so much for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on holiday throughout the time of repair and it was comforting to know it had actually been looked after and prepared to go upon our return. For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can rely on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. Over time, the product your drain is made of can start to rust, degrade, and ultimately fracture with normal use, resulting in a leak. If there is water pooling under your sink or damp areas and signs of water damage, you might have a leaking drain.
