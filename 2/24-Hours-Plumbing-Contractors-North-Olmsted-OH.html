<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
