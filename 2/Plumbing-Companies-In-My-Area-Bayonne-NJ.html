<p>Just like other building and construction workers, work of steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters is sensitive to changes in the economy. On the one hand, employees may experience durations of joblessness when the overall level of building and construction falls. On the other hand, scarcities of workers may take place in some locations throughout peak periods of building activity.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or irreversible connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Local laws require yearly inspections to ensure your backflow prevention devices are working as they need to be since water contamination could pose a major public health risk. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that break with time and it is necessary that they receivethe very same regular maintenance that your automobile or A/C system gets to guarantee your family's water is safe & clean.</p>
