<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
