<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
