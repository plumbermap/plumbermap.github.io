<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
