<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall costs. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
