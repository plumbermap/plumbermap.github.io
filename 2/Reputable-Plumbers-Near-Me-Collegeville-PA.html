<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow issues and even stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the offered volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
