<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Thomson GA 30824</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
