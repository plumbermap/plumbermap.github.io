Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
