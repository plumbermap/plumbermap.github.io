<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with negative pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is taking place.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
