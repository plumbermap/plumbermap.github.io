<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
