<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess.

I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either little or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
