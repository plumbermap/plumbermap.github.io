<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is occurring.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion assists force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a customer on a customized home, they will work straight with the property owner when it concerns picking faucets and other components.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
