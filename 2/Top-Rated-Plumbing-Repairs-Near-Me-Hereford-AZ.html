Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
