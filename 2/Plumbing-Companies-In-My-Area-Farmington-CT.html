Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in just one instructions. In a vulnerable water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream backwards into the drinkable water system.
