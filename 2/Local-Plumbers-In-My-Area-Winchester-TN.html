<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Bad Smells - If foul smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not correctly draining water. Unpleasant stenches are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up accumulates, it can lead to stronger odors, and more severe piping problems. Without functional draining, excessive pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak leading to costly water damage.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to maintain down flow. The plumbing system is tested for leakages. We inspect that the product used in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing laboratory. We restrict cross connections between safe water and water from a doubtful source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also inspect the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
