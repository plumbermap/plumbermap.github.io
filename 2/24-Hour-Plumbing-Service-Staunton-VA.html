<p>Thank you so much for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had actually been on vacation throughout the time of repair and it was reassuring to understand it had actually been looked after and prepared to go upon our return.

<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you've found the trip lever you want remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
