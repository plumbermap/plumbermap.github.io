<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt.

If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
