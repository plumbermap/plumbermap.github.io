<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
