Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
