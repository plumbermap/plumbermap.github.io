<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
