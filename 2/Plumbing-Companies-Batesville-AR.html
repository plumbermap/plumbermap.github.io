<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
