The water in your shower, sink, or toilet drains gradually - This is the most common sign that you have actually got a drain interruption. While slow draining implies the drain isn't totally clogged, there's still enough accumulation inside it to stop water and waste from decreasing easy.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
