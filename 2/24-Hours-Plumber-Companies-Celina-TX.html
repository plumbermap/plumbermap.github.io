Depending upon the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a couple of days to a week to finish. Do not fret, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furniture, floors and other valuables so that our work doesn't make a mess.

<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
