<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Geismar LA 70734</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the clog, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

With time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
