<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
