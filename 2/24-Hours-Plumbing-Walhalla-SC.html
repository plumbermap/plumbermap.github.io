<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.
