<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Winter Garden FL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with many homeowners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
