<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
