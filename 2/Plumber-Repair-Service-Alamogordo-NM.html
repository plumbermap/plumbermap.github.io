<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers end up being disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair.

<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
