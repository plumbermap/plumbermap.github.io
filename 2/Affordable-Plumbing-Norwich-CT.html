<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Norwich CT</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat various actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
