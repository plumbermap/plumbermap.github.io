<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Stony Point NY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
