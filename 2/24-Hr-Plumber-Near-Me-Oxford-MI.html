<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
