During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
