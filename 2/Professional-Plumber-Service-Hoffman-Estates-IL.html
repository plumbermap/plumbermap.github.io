<p>Instead of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter specialists will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it rapidly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the best choice for your home or service.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
