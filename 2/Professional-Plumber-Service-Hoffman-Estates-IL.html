<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Hoffman Estates IL</h3>
<p>Instead of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter specialists will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it rapidly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the best choice for your home or service.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
