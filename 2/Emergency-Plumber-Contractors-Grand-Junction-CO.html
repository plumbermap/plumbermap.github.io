<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Grand Junction CO 81504</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
