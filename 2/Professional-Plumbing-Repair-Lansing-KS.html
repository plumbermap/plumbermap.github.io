<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Companies in Lansing</h2>

In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale growth or rust.
