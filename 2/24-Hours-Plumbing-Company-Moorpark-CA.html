<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does occur regularly than you believe! Typically it occurs at night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

A backflow preventer plays an important role in separating safe and clean drinking water from non-potable wastewater.
