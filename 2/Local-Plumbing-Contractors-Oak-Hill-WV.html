<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Oak Hill WV</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If your problem is more related to scale and mineral build-up, it is necessary to be mindful that the majority of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is caused by difficult water. Difficult water usually leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being rather unsightly. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will certainly help, we strongly suggest you check out setting up a water softener to aid with your difficult water.</p>
