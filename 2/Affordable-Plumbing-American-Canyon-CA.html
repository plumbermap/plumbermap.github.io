<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on extremely technical knowledge and specialized devices to determine the location of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and determine the area of those leaks at which visible water may or might not have appeared. Water temperature level issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
