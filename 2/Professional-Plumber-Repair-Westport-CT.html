<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Westport CT</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If your problem is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation, it is essential to be mindful that many scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is triggered by hard water. Hard water generally leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being rather unattractive. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will certainly help, we highly recommend you check out installing a water softener to assist with your tough water.</p>
