<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does take place more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
