Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and remarkably effective at eliminating grime, waste, and natural product that so often blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem.

<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
