<p>Our plumber groups aim to keep your house and work locations efficient, comfortable and functional. Another indication your disposal needs replacement would be odd sounds. It might be in need of major repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life-span if your disposal is frequently making sounds that are irregular for the machine. Regular clogs, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could suggest an issue with the disposal. It is probably due to too much usage over a long period of time if there are leakages coming from your system. Many of these leaks can be fixed, however if they end up being bigger and more regular, you must consider overall system replacement.</p>
<p>Check to make sure it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make certain it's running correctly. If the disposal has overheated, you might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system underneath the sink.</p>
