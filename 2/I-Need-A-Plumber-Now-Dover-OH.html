As a result, the softening tanks need to be cleaned up a lot more frequently, when rock salt is used.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
