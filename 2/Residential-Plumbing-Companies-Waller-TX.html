<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Waller Texas</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually accomplished a development in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates momentary firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment when it comes to drains.
