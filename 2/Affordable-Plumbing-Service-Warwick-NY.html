<p>When compared to gas designs, electric designs are simpler and cheaper to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line.

<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
