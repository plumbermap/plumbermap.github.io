<p>It is essential that you address any and all problems that you discover in the house's plumbing system (or elsewhere in the house, for that matter) with the seller or realtor prior to making a deal or closing the sale.

If you are a bit useful and have the time to do repair yourself, you can likewise use the results from your home plumbing inspection to work out a lower price on the house to accommodate for the supplies and labor associated with fixing any problem points.</p>
