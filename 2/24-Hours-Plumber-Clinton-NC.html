<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make certain it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks.
