<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is essential to the safety of your workers and customers. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Move the new hot water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. If the tubing does not line up, offset the lines as needed with sets of 45-degree elbows.</p>
<p>Circulation pipes transition to even smaller private service pipes, bring water to individual homes, house organisations, stores and buildings. Depending on need, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water gets in the customer facility through a water meter that records flow rates and water usage for billing functions. Individual service pipelines are typically made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be critical.</p>
