<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly various steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
