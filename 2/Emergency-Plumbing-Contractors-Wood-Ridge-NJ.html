<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
