<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
