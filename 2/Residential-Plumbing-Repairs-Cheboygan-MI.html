<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical adequate that many people choose do-it-yourself repairs. However sometimes even determining the leak can be a problem.

<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
