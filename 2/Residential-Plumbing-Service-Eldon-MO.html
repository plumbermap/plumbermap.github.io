<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program established by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program uses minor installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing licenses for specific kinds of minor electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer failed inspection due to excessive plants. Please trim your plants and schedule testing with a company from our certified tester list This should be finished within 30 days to prevent water service disruption.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally two layers of protection. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way. There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly specified-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
