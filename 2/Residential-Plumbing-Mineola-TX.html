<p>More than frequently, little leakages in our houses are quickly repaired through welding and we disregard it as a minor problem. But if the leak problems are frequent and from time to time some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to check the entire piping system to perform home repiping. Numerous leakages shouldn't be disregarded at all; else it may cause complicated flooding concern soon.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
